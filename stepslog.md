## Installed linux subsytem on windows using wsl 
- followed instructions on command prompt including restart
## Running ubuntu linkux
- Was stuck in an install loop, this should take only a few minutes.
- afer waiting for about 20 minutes, i used ctrl+c to breal the loop per a forum reccommendation
- Noticed that i was then able to create my username, and then password (had to enter twice after username to bring up password prompt , it took an extra CRLF)
